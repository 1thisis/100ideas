1. AI Neural Network and Deep Fake:
In recent few years, more and more deep faked videos have went virus on the internet. By collecting facial datas, AI can generate a new face or modify the face on an existed model. This technology can be helpful in the film production, and recreation of special experience. But meanwhile, the production of fake and inproper news, videos, and live stream is also growing. So the proper use of this technology became the new issue that gathered all the attentions. 

2. VR in Education:
The development of VR is mainly driven by two Industries: Game and Education. Other than just using VR technology to create a more realistic and excited game experiencem VR can also be used efficiently in creating a better education. Such as tutoring, STEM development, filed trips, and even distant education. The implement of VR in education will provide larger groups of child more opportunities to have better qulitied educations and made the accessibility of education easier and faster. 

3. Hyperloop: 
Hyperloop is an ongoing project proposed and practiced by Elon Musk's company SpaceX. It's an innovative idea to change the future of the traffic system. This techonology is aimsing to create a transportation that is more efficient and organized by developing a traffic network underground with composite meaterials that are more affordable. 

4. AR in Narrative Storytelling:
After meeting Asad J Malik and learning about his Interactive studio 1RIC, I started to have more interetd in how to imply AR in narrative storytelling and even art making. Using AR to create a interative movie expereince is innovative. As the form of Cinema have grown from 2D screening to 3D screening, audience desire towards a more realistic watching experience is growing as well. So the AR technology will be the key to open up the door towards the next cinema generation.  

5. Self-driving Car:
Self-driving car is the future of transportation. People normally pay a big amount of attention to the safty of the practice of self-driving cars. But as the refinement of datas that were gained from doing more experiments in all over the world in terms of the diversity. Self-driving technology has grown mature enough to ensure safty when driving. The next step towards the fully implement of Self-driving car is the possibility of humanize the machine and how to make it more efficient.
